"# MediaBot" 
Just a dumb discord bot that makes channels media only.

Add it to the server, give it access to the channel in question (or add it to the channel), and type /media-only
The bot auto deletes any post without an embed or attachment, as long as it's not in a thread.

The bot will also remove any attachment or embed that is not of an image or video type.

Will ask for these permissions:\
