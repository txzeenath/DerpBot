"# DerpBot" 
Just a dumb discord bot that makes channels media only.

Add it to the server, give it access to the channel in question (or add it to the channel), and type /media-only
The bot auto deletes any post without an embed or attachment, as long as it's not in a thread.

Will ask for these permissions:
Manage Messages
Read Message History
Read Messages/View Channels
Send Messages
